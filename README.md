# Applied Data Science & AI Research
This repository contains my work from the University of Cambridge PCE, focusing on the "Data Pipeline"—from raw data cleaning to deploying predictive models.

### 🧪 Focus Areas
- **Data Wrangling:** Using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to clean and transform unstructured datasets.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Building robust algorithms with **Scikit-Learn** to predict trends and automate reporting.
- **Real-world Dataset Projects** Miniprojects on excelling the DS&ML
